      <p className="about-me"> My name is Jackie Ha, and I am a full stack developer with a passion for technology
        that can help people. I first fell in love with coding after teaching myself HTML and CSS and making
        a few mock blogs for Harry Potter characters. I enjoyed playing around with code and seeing functionality change.
        I have experience with Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React and Redux, and Iâ€™m
        looking for some opportunities where I can grow as a developer.
        On a more personal note, I love the NYC food scene and am a behavioral economics enthusiast.</p>
